title: Who am I?

Student at FI MU, maybe at your local favourite school soon ™️. Outside of university and work-related obligations, I am a fan of hiking, urbex and writing occassional journal entries about practically anything that piques my interest.

## Professionally

I have experience coding in React, Vue.js, Flutter from my current work at CZS. My professional output from these projects are https://educalliance.eu and https://studyatmasaryk.cz/. I also have extensive experience scripting in Python and Node.js from various smaller hobby projects, including extensive data hoarding and managing over 210TB of data across multiple shard accounts.

From MU, I have been taught how to code in C++, C#, Javascript/Typescript/Node.js, C, Python,  Java and Haskell. The order signifies my love for the languages, from best to worst (Haskell is a devil's machine).

Outside of IT, I have worked in construction (contract worker, experience with machinery and welding equipment) and hotel industry (currently working as receptionist at SKM MU, planning to end this job by 2022). Also I am a member of the Accomodation Board at MU, where I am trying to assess and analyze the PR of SKM from the insider's perspective.
